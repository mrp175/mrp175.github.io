  <h4> About Me</h4>
  <p>Hi I'm Ptolemy and I've always been interested in building things. When I was 4 I was obsessed with making paper aeroplanes, then my obsession moved on to Lego and K'nex. At 11 I got my hands on a copy of Propellerhead's Reason 2.5. I made my first electronic music composition in 2003. I haven't stopped making music to this day.</p>

  <p>I completed a BSc in Music and Sound Technology in 2016, and whilst it wasn't perhaps quite what I expected, it was a great experience. One of my favourite units was the creation of an audio plugin written entirely in MaxMSP, a visual programming language for music and multimedia. I was surprised by the similar approach between programming and music production, but I also realised that programming wasn't as difficult as I once thought! </p>

  <p>Recntly, I have discovered the awesome Founders and Coders and have been working towards completing my application for the bootcamp.</p>
