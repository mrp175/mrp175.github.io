            Hi, I’m Ptolemy (that's me in the red) and welcome to my website as part of my application for Founders and Coders. This website was created using vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript. One of the requirements was that this website needed only be one page. I wanted to add functionality that would mimic a multiple page website, and so undertook the challenge to have multiple pseudo pages that are shown and hidden using Javascript. You’ll notice that the URL never changes. Please have a look round. I've included some of my projects that I have worked on in recent years as well as links to some of my music. For me, this website, is an opportunity to show why I want to join Founders & Coders, what I think I can offer, and my goals for the future.

            Hi. I’m Ptolemy. After finishing my degree in music and sound technology, I wasn’t exactly sure what I wanted to do with my life. Originally, I wanted to be the next super star DJ, but in the incredibly competitive market I was forced to bow out and find something more down to earth. Whilst my love for music lives on, I found that helping others can be incredibly rewarding too, so started working for the NHS at the Gender Identity Development Service in 2016. It is a highly specialised clinic for young people who are struggling with their gender identity. It's an incredible place to work with a great and diverse team who all work incredibly hard to support young people who are navigating new and often difficult choices. I find this field fascinating and absolutely take pride in my contribution to the help that we provide as well as the progress that we have collectively made in recent years. However, more and more recently, I have really been looking for something that will challenge me on a more creative and technical level.
          
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">

            Having made music for the past 15 years in my spare time has been my outlet for this, but since finding Founders and Coders and having so much fun working through the prerequisites and seeing what is possible with a bit of technical know how, I am hoping to get on the course and am ultimately really looking forward to starting a career in web development!

        <div class="text-border-main">

          <p class="card-text">

            In 2016 I completed work on a university project with the creation of an audio plugin using MaxMSP. MaxMSP is a visual programming language which is specifically designed for sound and multimedia. The design of the program itself is modular, whereby you create objects that perform very specific functions, but can be wired up to each other to create very complex and interesting projects. Whilst it was somewhat buggy, and limiting in some ways, especially for a novice like myself in that I couldn't always find ways to do things, it was great fun and really opened up my eyes to the possibilites of programming. 
          </p>

           <p class="card-text">
            The plugin, which I have called The Enveloper, is an audio effects unit which centres around the use of an envelope follow to modulate a number of effects. In simple terms, an evelope follower follows the volume of a sound over time and then outputs data based on how loud it is. You can have a look at a demo video of my working project below, but I strongly suggest you take a look at my blog for this project as it really gives a better idea of how things work, the processes involved in the creation of such a device, and an insight into my way of working as well.
