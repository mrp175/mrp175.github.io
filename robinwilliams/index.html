        <p style="text-align: justify"> Robin Williams, the funnyman who made not just America but the whole world laugh at his wonderful antics, was an American actor and comedian loved equally by both kids and adults for his quirky expressions, charming clumsiness, and innocent yet
          witty dialogues. Even though he was more famous as a comedian, Williams was a very talented personality who could pull off a very serious role with the same ease as he performed a comedic one.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
          Thrice nominated for the coveted Academy Awards, he won it once for his much acclaimed performance in the movie ‘Good Will Hunting’. The son of a senior executive, showbiz seemed to be an unlikely career path for the young Robin. As a boy he always joked
          around at school and made others laugh. No doubt his classmates voted him the “Funniest”!

        <p style="text-align: justify">
          He began his career as a stand-up comedian where he found success. One thing led to another and soon he was on television doing comedy shows. The hit sitcom ‘Mork & Mindy’ made him so popular that he realized that he was meant for greater success. Thus,
          he entered the world of movies and became the funnyman everyone fell in love with. Sadly, he passed away in 2014, but his memory will live on through the iconic roles he played over the years.
